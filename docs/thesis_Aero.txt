Preface
This thesis investigates the aerodynamic drag of a flying boat hull, and methods to reduce this
drag. This work is the final thesis of a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering.
The work in this thesis is part of the ongoing development of a clean sheet, electric flying boat.
Most of the research done on the subject of flying boat hulls was done over 60 years ago. With
the increased importance of optimizing aerodynamic drag due to the range challenges of electric
flight, as well as new possibilities brought on by the design freedom of composites and new
development methods like CFD, this thesis aims to aid in the development of new means of
transportation, electric flight.
I would like to thank my supervisor, Anna Olsen, for all her help and a lot of good guidance
and support. I would also like to thank the team at the NTNU wind tunnel and, in particular,
Srikar Yadala V, for allowing me to use their facility for this thesis and for all the help prior to,
during, and after the testing.
I also wish to thank the team at Elfly for the support during the work on this thesis. I especially
want to thank Kenzo Sasaki for his guidance.

Abstract
With global warming becoming an increasingly critical challenge, the development of sustainable
aviation technologies is essential. This thesis investigates methods to reduce the aerodynamic
drag of a nine-passenger, electric flying boat hull to improve its efficiency and viability for zero-
emission transport.
Using a combination of literature review, wind tunnel testing, and computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) analysis, this study examines the aerodynamic effects of design features such as step
geometry and fairings, afterbody angle, and overall hull dimensions. The thesis also briefly
considers how changes to these features might impact hydrodynamic performance, ensuring a
balanced design approach.
Due to challenges with the accuracy of the wind tunnel testing, the results from this part of the
thesis were not directly transferable, but the results were used in order to calibrate the CFD
results.
Results demonstrate that aerodynamic drag can be reduced significantly, potentially by 15%
to 20%, with the most substantial improvements achieved through step fairings and optimizing
the hull’s angle of incidence. Fairing the step alone offers a reduction of up to 15%, with drag
reductions showing a non-linear relationship to the extent of fairing applied. These findings
highlight key opportunities for advancing the design of electric flying boats.

Sammendrag
Global oppvarming utgjør en stadig mer kritisk utfordring. Det er derfor essensielt å utvikle
mer bærekraftige løsninger innen alle områder, inkludert luftfart. Denne oppgaven undersøker
metoder for a redusere den aerodynamiske motstanden til skroget på en elektrisk flybåt med plass
til ni passasjerer, for å forbedre effektiviteten og akselerere overgangen til nullutslipps luftfart.
Gjennom en kombinasjon av litteraturstudier, vindtunneltesting og CFD-analyse undersøker
studien geometriske endringer for å bedre aerodynamikken, spesielt rundt "step" regionen og
vinkelen på bakre del av skroget. Oppgaven vurderer også kort hvordan disse endringene vil
påvirke de hydrodynamiske egenskapene til flyet.
Grunnet utfordringer med nøyaktigheten på vindtunnel testingen var ikke resultatene fra denne
delen av studien direkte overførbar, men kunne isteden brukes for å validere CFD modellen.
Resultatene viser at den aerodynamiske motstanden kan reduseres betydelig, potensielt med 15%
til20%, derde størsteforbedringene oppnåsgjennom ådelvis retteut "steppet"og endrevinkelen
på skroget i forhold til luftstrømmen. Ved å delvis dekke til "steppet" kunne den aerodynamiske
motstanden reduseres med opptil 15%.

1 INTRODUCTION
1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Globally, aviation accounts for about 4% of the total global greenhouse emissions to date. With
passenger numbers rising by 3% yearly, this share in total emissions is predicted to double by
2050. (Klöwer 2021) With global warming set to exceed the 2015 Paris 1.5 degree goal in 2024,
reducing all sources of greenhouse gasses is more crucial than ever. (C3S 2024) The TAC1
program aims to accelerate this transition by electrifying seaplanes, one of the available market
segments with the shortest range requirements. The TAC1 program aims to develop a clean-
sheet, nine-passenger electric flying boat certified under EASA CS23 regulations.
1.2 Thesis Objective
Due to batteries’ relatively poor energy density (1.4 MJ/kg) compared to jet fuel (42 MJ/kg),
reducing the required energy for flight is an important step toward the viability of electric flight.
The objective of this thesis is therefore:
Investigate potentials for reducing the aerodynamic drag of the TAC1 flying boat hull.
Reducing the aerodynamic will also decrease operating cost for an electric aircraft. Although
electricity is relatively cheap, compared to jet fuel, high performance batteries do not last that
long, and will have to be replaced at a regular basis. This makes battery cost a variable cost,
in the same way as fuel, and will be a major driving cost of operations. By reducing the energy
consumption, the battery wear, and thereby, cost, will be reduced.
1.3 Scope
The thesis will focus on the aerodynamic drag of the fuselage and hull of the aircraft. The wings,
tail section, and external equipment are considered outside the scope of this thesis.
The thesis consists of the following sections:
• An introduction to the hydrodynamics of flying boat
• A literature study on aerodynamic refinements of flying boats
• An experiment section in the large wind tunnel at NTNU
1

1 INTRODUCTION
• A CFD study investigating the step drag
The initial literature study focused broadly on the fuselage. At the same time, for the experiment
section, it was decided to reduce the scope further only to consider the step section and afterbody
angle. These features were chosen due to their relatively large contribution to aerodynamic drag.
This thesis is only one part of the development of the TAC1 hull. The work on aerodynamics in
this thesis will be combined with hydrodynamic research and tests from other work, as well as
commercial and operational limitations to derive the final shape.
1.4 Requirements and Standards
As the TAC1 program aims to certify the aircraft for commercial operations under CS23 Level
3, applicable standards and requirements must be met. Many aircraft performance requirements
are affected by aircraft drag, but the most critical requirements regarding the fuselage and hull
are those concerning safety during water operation.
From CS23 Amendment 4: (EASA 2015)
• Section 75c: "The landing must be made without excessive vertical acceleration or
tendency to bounce, nose-over, ground loop, porpoise or water loop."
• Section 231a: "A seaplane or amphibian may not have dangerous or uncontrollable
porpoising characteristics at any normal operating speed on the water."
• Section 233d: "Seaplanes must demonstrate satisfactory directional stability and
control for water operations up to the maximum wind velocity specified in sub-
paragraph (a)."
1.5 Seaplanes
Seaplanes are currently being operated by about 40 commercial operators in many regions
around the world, for both short-haul costal transport and sightseeing missions, most notably
the Maldives and the Vancouver area. These missions are typically very short, with an average
range of 75 km, making them well-suited for electric aviation.
Seaplanes can in general be split in two classes: Float planes which utilize external floats below
the fuselage to provide buoyancy, and flying boats which utilize the fuselage as the body of
contact with the water. The TAC1 aircraft is a flying boat.

2 HYDRODYNAMICS OF FLYING BOAT HULLS
2 Hydrodynamics of Flying Boat Hulls
In addition to functioning as aircraft, seaplanes must function as boats. In order to achieve
sufficient handling on water during taxiing, takeoff and landing, their shape must deviate from
that of a relatively streamlined land plane. If one tries to optimize the aerodynamics of a
seaplane without understanding the hydrodynamics, the design would easily trend towards that
of a circular fuselage land plane shape, resulting in poor water characteristics. In order to
optimize the aerodynamics, it is therefore important to understand what features are added to a
seaplane hull and how they affect the hydrodynamic performance. This section aims to outline
the basics of flying boat hydrodynamical design. (deCallies 1967).
A typical flying boat hull can be seen in Figure 2.1. A design goal can then be set for a specific
hydrodynamic performance, and different characteristics can be tweaked in order to achieve that
performance at the least aerodynamic penalty possible.
Figure 2.1: Side-view of an example flying boat. Figure borrowed from Thurston (1978)
2.1 Hydrodynamic Performance
There are four primary factors that can be considered as hydrodynamic performance.
Hydrodynamic resistanceis the water drag that acts on the hull when it moves through the
water. Generally, we want to reduce this in order to decrease the takeoff distance and power
requirement of the motor. Shorter takeoffs mean less time for something to go wrong, like hitting
an object in the sea or starting porpoising. Several flying boats are actually unstable, but avoid
porpoising by accelerating through the unstable region before it becomes a problem. (Smith and
White 1954)
3

2 HYDRODYNAMICS OF FLYING BOAT HULLS
During landing, hydrodynamic resistance is less important and can even be a good thing, slowing
the aircraft down faster.
Dynamic stabilityrefers to the stability in roll, yaw, and pitch, as well as heave, as the aircraft
moves through the water. Especially instability in pitch and heave can be dangerous for seaplanes
during takeoff and landing.
Spray is the water that gets pushed up and out from the hull as the hull moves through the
water. This spray can seriously damage the propeller and control surfaces of the aircraft and
needs to be minimized. Spray characteristic is an entire topic in itself and is considered outside
the scope of this thesis.
Landing loadsis the force on the hull during landing and is a big driver of hull strength and,
thereby, hull weight.
In addition to these considerations, other factors like low-speed maneuverability also fall into the
category of hydrodynamic performance.
2.2 Basic Seaplane Hull
Figure 2.2 shows the gradual change from a streamlined body (shape 1). In the second shape,
the tail is swept up. This is also done on most land planes in order to give tail clearance to allow
for rotation during takeoff and landing. For seaplanes, the tail is also swept up to reduce the
spray that hits the tail, which increases the resistance. (Coombes and Clark 1937)

relative drag as a percentage of the full flying boat hull. Figure borrowed from (Coombes and Clark 1937)

Figure 2.2, shape 3 shows a hull with a sharp keel. The angleβ, seen in Figure 2.3 is known
as the deadrise angle. The sharp keel decreases water landing loads, adds lateral stability, and
helps control spray at the cost of increased hydrodynamical resistance.
At the intersection between the hull and the fuselage there is also typically a sharp break, known
as the chine. The chines helps reduce the spray. The hull may also have a concave shape, with a
larger deadrise angle at the keel, which further decreases landing loads and reduces spray. This
is known as flare. (Coombes and Clark 1937) (Thurston 1978)
Figure 2.3: Illustration of deadrise angle, with and without flare. Image edited based on two original
images from (Thurston 1978)
Figure 2.2, shape 4 shows the addition of sharp breaks in the shape around the mid and aft
sections. This is done to create a flow separation for the water and spray to break clear of the
aft body. Shape 5 adds a flat indent or plane, referred to as a step, to the discontinuity line in
order to increase the breakage. This step is one of the major drivers of drag for seaplane hulls,
and this is the main focus point of this thesis. Without the features in shapes 4 and 5, the shape
would, in effect, create an upside-down airfoil in the water, causing water spray to fly upwards
behind the body and, subsequently, creating a suction force that would pull the hull down into
the water and prevent it from taking off. (Coombes and Clark 1937)
2.3 Take-off Performance
During stationary and low speed, the hull of a flying boat acts as a displacement hull. The weight
of the water displaced equals the weight of the aircraft. During a takeoff, as speed increases, the
hull starts to generate hydrodynamic lift, lifting the hull out of the water into a planning stage.
As the speed increases further, the hydrodynamic lift is slowly replaced by aerodynamic lift until
the aircraft reaches takeoff speed. These phases can be seen in figure 2.4. (deCallies 1967)
The point of maximum resistance occurs during the transition from displacement to planning,
5

2 HYDRODYNAMICS OF FLYING BOAT HULLS
Figure 2.4: Phases during takeoff. Source of figure: Recolored by prof. E. Wilczek, based on data from
Sottorf (1937)
as the aircraft is lifting itself out of the water. This point is referred to as the hump. A sharp
increase in pitch (also known as trim) can be seen in figure 2.4 in this phase. Once the hull is
out of the water, the pitch decreases, and the water resistance decreases again. (deCallies 1967)
Importantly, the available thrust must be larger than the sum of the resistance. The rate of
acceleration will be the difference between the thrust and the drag over the mass of the aircraft.
2.4 Hydrodynamic Resistance
Each of the four phases introduced in section 2.3 comes with different mechanisms for
hydrodynamic drag. Depending on which phase we want to optimize for, the design will differ.
Some general trends do also exist, like deadrise angle, where hydrodynamic drag increases with
increasing angle, especially for the planning phases (Sottorf 1937)
The following section is a general explanation of the hydrodynamic drag, in the four phases as
shown in figure 2.4
In phase 1the displacement phase, the flying boat hull creates relatively high drag compared to
a more streamlined hull. This is not of great concern in terms of takeoff performance, however,
as the excess thrust is large in this phase, leading to a fast acceleration into stage two. The drag
in this phase does matter, however, if the aircraft is expected to see long taxiing runs. Combined
6

2 HYDRODYNAMICS OF FLYING BOAT HULLS
with the poor efficiency of the propeller in this phase, some energy could be saved by reducing
the drag. During this stage, an air bubble will be drawn in by the negative pressure behind the
step and start to reduce the whetted area of the after body, as seen in figure 2.5. (Sottorf 1937)
Figure 2.5: Hydrodynamic forces during displacement phase. Figure borrowed from Sottorf (1937)
In phase 2the air trapped behind the step increases in length, while the impact pressure on
the forebody increases, both working to move the center of pressure forward. This causes a
pitch-up movement that increases the hydrodynamic lift, and the hull lifts out of the water. This
lifting movement moves the center of pressure aft again, causing a pitch down once the hull is in
planning mode. The maximum hydrodynamic drag will be somewhere in the region around the
maximum pitch, and it is important to have sufficient excess thrust to overcome this resistance.
(ibid.).
In phase 3the hull is fully planning and only a small part of the hull in front of the step is in
contact with the water. As speed increases, this patch of contact with the water decreases in size,
caused by load shifting from hydrodynamic to aerodynamic lift from the wing. The decrease in
contact with the water also moves the center of pressure further aft, slowly decreasing pitch.
In phase 4the pitch has to increase in order to increase wing lift and lift the aircraft out of the
water. This pitch-up increases the spray and drag on the aft body, as can be seen in figure 2.6.
As the thrust curve also comes down at this point, a second critical phase occurs where drag
could exceed thrust.
Figure 2.6: Spray aft of the step, onto the after body. Source of figure: Recolored by prof. E. Wilczek,
based on drawing by (Sottorf 1937)
It should be noted that different hulls will differ in these characteristics. deCallies (1967) does
7

2 HYDRODYNAMICS OF FLYING BOAT HULLS
not report an increase in hydrodynamic drag during step four, most likely due to having looked
at different hull geometries.
2.5 Dynamic Stability
When under very low speed or stationary, the center of buoyant forces vs the center of gravity
and wind loads are the primary drivers of stability. At higher speeds, the hydrodynamic forces,
and increasingly with speed, aerodynamic forces take over. This thesis will focus on the stability
when moving, known as dynamic stability, as static stability is primarily a function of the overall
hull width, the height of the center of gravity, and tip float size, neither of which is a focus of
this thesis. The most critical factor for dynamic stability is the longitudinal stability. Here,
there are two characteristics that can be critical for a seaplane during takeoff or landing: The
following section is primarily based on the findings of Smith and White (1954), and Olson and
Land (1942).
Figure 2.7: Illustration of severe porpoising leading to takeoff at too low speed, and subsequent stall and
crash. Figure borrowed from FFA (2014)
Porpoising is an oscillating change in pitch, typically defined at a minimum amplitude of 2
degrees. Higher amplitudes may be acceptable, but this is dependent on duration, pilot skill,
and the speed at which it occurs. The main danger of porpoising is increased stress on the
airframe, increased spray, and premature takeoff with a subsequent stall. Generally, porpoising
becomes more critical with higher speed. The instability may be self-sustaining or self-dampened.
Some highly unstable seaplanes might start porpoising without the aid of external disturbance,
while other planes require an external disturbance like a wave or sudden change in pitching
moment from high-mounted engines to start porpoising. Smith and White (1944) report that
porpoising seems to be more likely to occur during pitch-down rather than pitch-up disturbance.
This effect has a bigger impact on landings, as the thrust line VS. dragline makes the aircraft
more likely to have pitch-down moments during landing. (Smith and White 1954)
It is also important to consider the time component of instability. While one method to determine
the stability limit is to run tests at a constant speed and measure instability, this represents the
8

2 HYDRODYNAMICS OF FLYING BOAT HULLS
real-world conditions poorly, as an aircraft may pass through an unstable range as long as the
acceleration is sufficient to prevent instability from occurring. (Smith and White 1954) This
makes the reduction of hydrodynamic drag one of the key ways to combat instability during
takeoff.
Benson and Freihofner (1944) Benson and Freihofner (1944) tested the landing stability of a
model of a flying boat where the depth of the step was reduced to zero by using a retractable
step. This model was unstable in landings, but as long as the deceleration was sufficient, the
instability oscillations would be acceptable.
Skippingis a form of porpoising that also includes a heave motion and is commonly encountered
during landing. Skipping can have very severe consequences, as the aircraft may lift out of the
water during these oscillations. If the speed is then below stall speed, the aircraft will stall
and fall down to the water surface with a large force that may damage or destroy the airframe.
(Smith and White 1954)
Trim limitsdetermine within which range of pitch the seaplane will be stable. This is typically
not a hard line, but instability is more and more likely to occur the closer to the line one gets.
In addition, due to the time dependency, instability may also not occur if the lines are crossed
briefly. (ibid.)
Because of the increased sensitivity during pitch-down disturbance, compared to pitch-up
movement, as described above, trim limit graphs often come with one upper limit for decreasing
pitch and one higher one for increasing pitch disturbance. (Olson and Land 1942)
Forebody Porpoisingis caused by varying pressure on the forebody, just ahead of the step,
within the area marked pressure area in figure 2.6. This occurs during planning at low trim,
with little flow over the afterbody. During the hump region, the afterbody will normally prevent
this type of porpoising, as the afterbody will be partially submerged and dampen any change in
the center of pressure on the forebody. (Smith and White 1954) The primary design that affects
the forebody porpoising is the area immediately in front of the step.
Forebody - afterbody Porpoising is a type of porpoising that only occurs if two steps are
present, with the pressure area of the aft step oscillating. (ibid.)
Step Porpoisingis a type of porpoising that is caused by insufficient flow separation behind
the step. The water spray behind the step creates a suction force on the afterbody, which may

oscillate, causing oscillation in pitch. Skipping is a type of step porpoising. Afterbody shape
and rise angle, known as sternpost angle, as well as the height and ventilation of the step, are
the most important methods to reduce this porpoising. (Smith and White 1954) An example of
the distribution of negative pressure aft of the step can be seen in Figure 2.9.

3 Aerodynamic Theory
3.1 Fundamentals of Fluid Dynamics
3.1.1 Types of Flow
Fluid flow over a surface will be either one of two types: laminar or turbulent. With laminar flow,
the fluid flows in the direction of flow, with very little motion or mixing in secondary directions.
For turbulent flow, the flow will have internal eddies and vortices, creating a much more uneven
and mixed flow. (Leishman 2024c)
3.1.2 Boundary Layer
When air flows over a surface, the air closest to the surface will stagnate and not move due to
the friction forces between the fluid molecules and the surface. This is called non-slip. Further
from the surface, the air will increase speed up to a point where the air is at free-flow speed.
This layer of slower-moving air, affected by shear forces in the fluid, is called the boundary layer.
The thickness of the boundary layer depends on many factors, like fluid viscosity, fluid velocity,
surface roughness, surface geometry, and whether the fluid is in turbulent or laminar flow. (ibid.)
Figure 3.1: Development of turbulent flow over a flat plate. Image edited based on an original image by
Leishman (2024c)
The thickness of the boundary layer is typically defined at where the flow speed is 99% of free
flow speed, and denoted withδ, and can be seen in figure 3.1. For turbulent flow, the boundary
layer will be thicker but also have a more uniform velocity profile due to mixing between the
layers. (ibid.)
Due to the mentioned shear forces in the fluid, the boundary layer is where the friction drag
12

3 AERODYNAMIC THEORY
originates and is, therefore, a very important area to study. Turbulent boundary layers will
generally have a higher aerodynamic drag than laminar ones. When designing aerodynamic
surfaces where low drag is a benefit, it is, therefore, generally a good idea to try to keep the flow
laminar as long as possible. (Leishman 2024c)
3.1.3 Flow Separation
Flow separation is when the flow is not able to follow the contours of the shape it flows over.
Turbulent flow is more resistant to separation than laminar flow. Flow separation causes a large
pressure drag behind the body, so turbulent flow may reduce drag. This feature can be exploited
by aerodynamic design, which is why golf balls have dimples. As seen in figure 3.2, the dimpled
surface causes a turbulent boundary layer, delaying flow separation. (ibid.)
Figure 3.2: Flow around a smooth ball vs golf ball, illustrating the delaying effect of flow sepeartion caused
by turbulence. Figure borrowed from Leishman (2024c)
3.2 Fundamentals of Aerodynamics and Flight Physics
As an aircraft is not restrained to 2D motion and may move and rotate along all three axes, some
definitions should be established about what cordite system to use and which forces act in which
axis system. There are four fundamental forces acting on an aircraft: Weight, Lift, Thrust, and
Drag. (Leishman 2024b)
The three main coordinate systems when describing aircraft motion are the body, earth, and
wind axis, as shown in figure 3.3a. Weight acts in the earth reference, lift and drag acts in the
wind reference, and thrust acts in the body coordinate system. The angle of attack is defined as
the difference between the body and wind axis. (ibid.)

Figure 3.3: Coordinate and rotation axis for an aircraft
There are also three axes’ of rotation, roll, yaw, and pitch, as seen in figure 3.3b. In this thesis,
the pitch is sometimes referred to as trim.
3.2.1 Aircraft Drag
Aerodynamic drag is defined as the force opposing motion. The force does not act along the
neutral axis of the body, as the thrust line does, but instead acts in the direction of the wind
reference axis, as seen in Figure 3.3a. It is caused by the interaction between the air and the
aircraft. (NASA 2022b)
Figure 3.4: Aerodynamic forces acting on an airfoil. Image borrowed from: Leishman (2024a)
There are multiple ways to break down drag into categories, depending on what one wants to
show. The physics-based breakdown breaks the drag down into pressure and friction drag, as
14

3 AERODYNAMIC THEORY
seen in Figure 3.4. As the name implies, the pressure drag is caused by higher pressures acting
on the forward-facing surfaces than the rearwards-facing faces. This type of drag is related to
the form and frontal area of the body. The skin friction is caused by shear forces in the boundary
layer and primarily correlates with the surface area of the body. (Leishman 2024c)
Another common classification in aerospace is the difference between drag correlated with
generating lift (induced drag) and drag not correlated with lift (parasitic drag). (ibid.)
3.2.2 Drag Coefficient
The drag coefficient is a dimensionless number used to compare the aerodynamic efficiency of
shapes. Equation 3.1 is used to calculate this coefficient. The reference area used depends on
the application and must always be checked. For simple shapes, it is common to use the frontal
projected area or the surface area, while for aircraft, the wing area is typically used. (Ansys
2020a)
CD = FD
1
2 · ρ · V 2∞ · A (3.1)
Where:
* D is the drag in Newtons
* ρ is the air density,
* V∞ is the free flow speed of the air in [m/s],
* A is the reference area,
Drag coefficients are useful due to the fact that a similar shape with a different size will give
the same drag coefficient. If one wants to compare the aerodynamic efficiency of two aircraft of
different sizes, the drag coefficient is a good way to go about it, assuming the wing loading is
similar. This can be seen in figure 3.5 where the two balls of 1:10 size difference have the same
drag count.(ibid.)
If the reference area is sufficiently large, the drag coefficient becomes so small that it becomes
hard to read, like 0.00323. In those cases, a more readable number may be used, called drag
count. Drag count isCD ∗104 and means the aforementioned example would be a more readable
value of 32.3 drag counts. (ibid.)

be seen to have very large variations in drag. Image has been edited based on two original images from
(Talay 1975)
3.2.3 Drag Bookkeeping
It can sometimes be hard to know which category to place drag, as it may be a combination
of features and factors that created the drag. One example is cooling drag that sometimes is
counted as its own drag source, while in other cases, it is accounted for as a reduction of thrust
of the motor. (Stauffer and Takahashi 2023) This becomes even more challenging if the outlet
for the cooling duct is oriented in a way as to reduce the low-pressure zone of another system,
thereby having a reducing component on another system’s drag. (Wolf 2004)
For the step, the pressure drag directly behind the step easily contributes to the step. The
increase or decrease of drag on the after body due to the turbulence and flow separation can,
however, be harder to define but should most likely also be attributed to the step.

This chapter outlines the current literature on the aerodynamic impact and potential for
improvements that can be made by refining a flying boat hull. Since the hulls used in the
referenced tests vary significantly, this section serves as a baseline to identify trends, prioritize
promising solutions for further testing, and provide reference values to detect and address any
unrealistic test results. The results found in this section may not be thought of as directly
applicable to the TAC1 hull without also being supported by a more targeted analysis. The
chapter is divided into two main categories, step, and overall hull shape:
Step
• Step height
• Step shape
• Step fairing
• Step ventilation
Overall hull shape
• Sternpost angle
• Tailcone upsweep
• Deadrise angle and warp
• Length/beam ratio
• Height/width ratio
• Chines radius
4.1 Method
When researching flying boat performance, some challenges were quickly identified. Firstly, the
number of sources on flying boat performance far exceeded what could reasonably be analyzed.
Secondly, most of these sources were very old, primarily from 1930 - 1950. Newer sources existed,
but these were primarily literature studies, using the older sources as primary sources. These
literature studies did not always reflect the data from the primary sources well. Several errors
and misrepresentations were found when looking at other literature studies. It was, therefore,
decided to focus on primary sources where possible. A challenge in avoiding referring to the
same test twice, as a lot of sources cited each other, was also identified.

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
4.1.1 Parametric Study of Drag
One good way to investigate the drag of certain features of a flying boat hull is to systematically
vary one feature, keep the rest of the hull similar, and measure the change in drag from that
one feature. This can give valuable data, but as drag from one feature can influence the flow
over other features, it is not certain that when multiple features are changed, the change in drag
will add up to the sum of the changes in drag expected based on individual tests. Wind tunnel
testing by Riebe and Naeseth (1947b) found that fairing the step reduced drag by 12% while
rounding the bow chines reduced drag by 5%. When both features were tested, the sum added
up to 14% drag reduction, not the expected 17%.
4.2 Aerodynamic Impact of the Step
One important factor in determining the amount of design effort to allocate to each design feature
is to estimate the impact and potential for improvement.
Prior to this thesis work, the drag contribution of the main step has been calculated to 16 drag
counts internally by Elfly, which is estimated to be 6.8% of total parasitic drag or 133N at cruise
speed. The method presented by Hoerner (1965) was used in this calculation. This corresponds
relatively well with results from full-scale aircraft, where the step drag is typically found to be
in the range of 2-3% of the full aircraft drag (parasitic and induced drag), considering this was
calculated for a straight, non-faired step. (Benson and Havens 1945)
4.2.1 Step Height
The typical depth of step for seaplanes is in the range of 5- 10% of the beam width. (Chicken
1999)
Effect on air drag
A summary of the aerodynamic drag vs step height as a percentage of the beam of four sources
can be seen in Figure 4.1a. The hulls in the comparison differ significantly, as can be seen in
Figure 4.1b. All the hulls are two-stepped hulls. However, the size and shape of the second step
differ. The size of the model and the number of features, like wing stubs in the test by Riebe
and Naeseth, will also affect the percentage a certain change in drag will make up.
The TAC1 hull is most similar to the hull tested by Benson and Lindsay. The 0% depth of step

used as a benchmark in that test still had a sharp break in angle.

related to the depth of the step
Effect on hydrodynamics
Impact on Stability: Olson and Land (1942) found that increasing the depth of step had no
effect on lower limit porpoising but had a large impact on the higher limit porpoising, as seen in
Figure 4.2. The figure also clearly shows the difference between decreasing trim and increasing
trim limits, as discussed in chapter 2.5

Impact on hydrodynamic Drag: Sottorf (1937) tested the hydrodynamic resistance with varying
depth of step. The results can be seen in figure 4.3. Each depth of step had a different region, and
it performed better or worse. In general, the higher the depth of step, the higher the resistance
19

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
at low speeds, and the lower the resistance at lower speeds. The lowest hump resistance came
from the medium step heights.
Figure 4.3: Hydrodynamic drag during takeoff run, as a function of step height. Source: Recolored in an
unpublished report by Prof E. Wilczek, based on original data from Sottorf (1937)
A similar result was found by Benson and Freihofner (1944) when comparing the hydrodynamic
resistance of a 5% of the beam and zero depth of step hull. The zero-step hull had lower resistance
up until right after the hump. The resistance of the zero-step hull then continued almost linearly
upwards, while the stepped hull had decreasing resistance after the hump.
4.2.2 Step Shape
The step of flying boat hulls may be straight, angled backward in a V-shape, or oval. An
illustration of straight and V-shaped steps can be seen in figure 4.4. Angling the step backward
will increase the effective depth of the step at the keel by a factor proportional to the sternpost
angle.
Effect on air drag
Coombes and Clark (1937) investigated the change of air drag from angling the step and found
that a 30◦ step had 4% higher drag than a straight step. If the angle was increased to 60%,
the drag came back down to that of a straight step. The same trend was observed for oval-
shaped steps, with the medium-angle shapes showing the highest drag. V-shaped steps will have
a varying depth of step, which could influence the overall drag if not corrected properly.

The same conclusion was reached, that V-shaped steps have higher drag, by wind tunnel test
conducted by Hartman (1935).
Effect on hydrodynamics
Parkinson and Land (1944) investigated the landing stability of V-shaped steps and found that
a V-shaped step with 25% less frontal area than a straight step gave similar landing stability.
Coombes and Clark (1937) mention that the hydrodynamic resistance is lower, although just
marginally so.
4.2.3 Step Fairings
Several sources have investigated the addition of fairings on the step in order to reduce the
aerodynamic drag while still having sufficient hydrodynamical performance. Coombes and Clark
(ibid.) found the relation seen in Figure 4.6, by wind tunnel testing 18 different fared steps. The
raw data from these tests, including sweeps on the angle of incidence, was published by Smith
(1957). The wind tunnel tests found a 70% reduction of step drag with a 6 times the depth of the
21

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
step with a straight step fairing. This fairing, however, also increased the hydrodynamic drag
during planning by 40%. A fairing from half the depth of the step could half the step drag, but
it needed to have a length at least 15 times the depth of the step. Concave steps were not found
to significantly reduce drag. The best trade-off was suggested to be with a fairing that started
at 1/4 depth of step and extended rearwards 9 times the depth of step. This fairing halved
the aerodynamic drag while only increasing the hydrodynamic drag at planning with 15%. No
information on the stability of this fairing was given.
Figure 4.6: Drag as a percentage of drag without step fairing over a range of fairing lengths. Figure
borrowed from Coombes and Clark (1937)
Benson and Havens (1945) investigated 15 different fared steps in a tank test with a scaled model
of a 30-ton flying boat. Six of the fairings incorporated ventilation, discussed further in Chapter
4.2.4. This paper highlighted a step with 1% depth of step unfaired, with a relatively large
ventilation (ventilation area 7% of the beam width squared) as favorable to a conventional step.
Hamilton (1956) tested several shapes of step fairings, as seen in Figure 4.7. The straight faring
9 times the depth of step reduced the drag almost up to the hull without step. The concave
fairing reduced drag by more than what was found by Coombes and Clark (1937) but still less
than the other fairings.

number (106). Figure borrowed from Hamilton (1956)
Conway and Maynard (1943) tested a total of 6 fairings, both straight, convex, and concave. One
of the concave fairings in this study had almost the same drag as a fully faired convex faring.
This concave fairing was chosen as a baseline for one of the concave fairings tested in the wind
tunnel.
Plan and elevation fairings are fairings that curve in more than one plane, as seen in Figure 4.7.
Riebe and Yates (1947) investigated the three steps seen in Figure 4.8. The one-step hull seen in
Figure 4.14, which is similar to the current proposed TAC1 hull, was also tested for comparison.
The hull 221A had an 18% reduction in drag compared to the comparison hull, which had a
drag coefficient of 0.0066. Hull 221C had a slightly less aggressive fairing, based on the same
principle, and had a drag reduction of 12%. The single plan form step fairing had less than
2% drag reduction compared to the comparison hull. It should be noted that the comparison
hull did not have a step fairing. Another paper by the same authors found a 15% decrease in
aerodynamic drag by fairing the comparison hull with a straight fairing 9 times the depth of the
step. (Yates and Riebe 1947)
These step fairings are very similar to the fairing on the Princess flying boat, a very streamlined
flying boat that reached an impressive L/D ratio of 19. (Smith 1959)
These step geometries, although promising, were not chosen for the wind tunnel testing. This
was due to the fact that they would require a larger modification to the hull than the straight
and concave steps.
23

Figure 4.8: Hulls tested by Riebe and Yates (1947)
4.2.4 Step Ventilation
As discussed in Chapter 2.5, one of the main reasons for porpoising is negative pressure aft of the
step. If the step is not sufficient to create an opening to let air into this region, air ducts can be
added going through the fuselage to add ventilation and equalize the pressure in this region. This
will increase the upper trim limits and reduce hydrodynamical drag. This negative pressure can
be quite high and cause the aircraft to stick to the water, making take-off impossible. Dornier
Do 18 flying boat measured 11.8 kPa negative pressure behind the step (Wilczek 2021) Tests
with the Sunderland, a flying boat of the same size, measured a negative pressure of 27.5 kPa.
(Hamilton 1956)
Hamilton (ibid.) investigated the effect of ventilation the step on the Sunderland flying boat. One
key finding was that ventilation alone, when the step height was reduced to zero and rounded off,
was not sufficient to reduce hydrodynamical resistance and instability. A full-scale investigation
into the hydrodynamical behavior of a highly faired flying boat hull
As mentioned in Chapter 4.2.3, Benson and Havens (1945) found that stable landings could be
made with only a 1% depth of step if the ventilation area was large enough. The source included
the recorded heave and pitch data for all 15 steps tested, giving a good indication of the different
degrees of proposing and skipping observed. These tests were for a two-step hull and would have
to be redone for the specific one-step TAC1 hull.
Forced ventilation
Some aircraft have experimented with the use of fans in order to push air into the region behind
the step. This does work, although the amount of air needed makes it highly impractical. The
Empire flying boat, a boat with a total weight of 20 metric tons, needed an airflow of about
11m3
s . (Tomaszewski, Smith and Chalmers 1946) An investigation by Hamilton (1947) found no
effect in forced ventilation, even for a much smaller, 2.7-ton aircraft.

4.2.5 Retractable Steps
When studying step design and the trade-off between hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, it can
be tempting to solve both problems at the same time by making a movable mechanism to retract
or extend the step, allowing for optimizing both air and water operation. Coombes and Clark
(1937) was one of the first to discuss the possibility of extendable/retraceable step geometries.
Benson and Lindsay (1943) investigated the use of a retractable step. A reduction of 8% in
hydrodynamic resistance, and 2-3% of aerodynamic resistance in flight was found
The drawback of a movable system is the increased complexity, weight, cost, and risk associated
with a movable mechanism. The step also has to sustain very high loads during take-off and
landings.
One of the most important factors in the feasibility of a movable mechanism is the criticality
of failure. DO-254 specifies maximum failure rates based on the criticality of events, as seen
in Figure 4.9. If safe landings can be made with the mechanism in the flight configurations,
the criticality level would probably be classified as Minor. If the event could cause an unstable
landing, the criticality level may increase to Hazardous. This may require the mechanism to
have redundancy or, in other ways, increase the cost and complexity of the mechanism. (Mistral
2024)

failure rates. (Mistral 2024)
Benson and Freihofner (1944) investigated the landing stability and hydrodynamical resistance
when landing with a step retracted to a 0% depth of step. This test showed a very stable landing
between a landing pitch of5.5◦ to 12◦. High-speed landings at lower trim than5.5◦ were stable
only if the deceleration was large enough. If the deceleration was insufficient, the aircraft would
trim up and take off again (skip). The deceleration curve of the model with and without the
25

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
step retracted can be seen in Figure 4.10a. Due to the higher hydrodynamical resistance without
a step, the landing length was reduced by 50%, which was a potentially valuable feature in
space-restricted areas.

4.3 Sternpost Angle
Sternpost angle is the angle of the fuselage after the step, as seen in Figure 2.1. For flying boats,
this angle is typically in the range of 5◦to 9◦.(Locke 1946) This is done primarily to reduce the
hydrodynamic resistance due to spray on the afterbody, but this angle also has a big impact on
the hydrodynamic stability and air drag.
Impact on aerodynamics
Coombes and Clark (1937) reported afterbody upsweep angle as one of the most significant
factors in reducing flying boat drag. The data from these tests were published publicly by Smith
Smith (1957) and can be seen in Figure 4.11b. A similar trend was found by Hartman (1935)
and can be seen in Figure 4.11a.
From Figure 4.11b it can also be seen that the minimum drag does not occur at 0◦of incidence.
Notably, the optimal angle of incidence increases with increased afterbody upsweep.
This is a well-documented phenomenon, and it is not only a percentage in flying boats.
Conventional land aircraft also have an upswept afterbody in order to give ground clearance
to avoid a tail strike during take-off. (Torenbeek 1982)

Figure 4.11: Ar drag vs angle of incidence
A similar effect as in Figure 4.11 can be seen in Figure 4.12. We can, therefore, be quite confident
in the effect of this parameter on aircraft drag, although the magnitude may vary from aircraft
to aircraft and is highly dependent on whether the flow separates or not. Flying boats are not
helped in this regard, given that they already have a sharp discontinuity (step) where the change
in direction occurs.

Effect on Hydrodynamics
Sottorf (1937) describes an increase in hydrodynamic resistance at the hump when increasing
the afterbody angle from 7◦to 9.5◦. This could be due to the higher afterbody angle causing
the aircraft to have a higher pitch due to the removal of buoyancy volume aft of the center of
gravity, increasing the resistance prior to planning.
The hydrodynamic drag during planning was reported to decrease slightly with increased
27

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
sternpost angle. (Sottorf 1937)
Afterbody angle also greatly influences the upper limit stability, which is the proposing type
known to cause skipping. Figure 4.13 shows the stability against skipping of a collection of
full-scale flying boats as a factor of beam loading (described in 2.6, sternpost angle, and step
height. Higher step height can be seen to decrease skipping while increasing the sternpost angle
or beam loading will increase the tendency to skip. In order to avoid skipping, Locke (1946)
recommends to stay above the dashed line. The data is derived from pilot interviews, where the
pilot experience was used to adjust the rating of stability.

4.4 Conventional VS. Planning Tail Hulls
Most of the sources in this chapter have done their testing on two-stepped hulls, often with the
rear step being pointed (highly faired in the plan form) as per the definition of Figure 4.7. These
hulls often also have a lower sternpost angle than one-step hulls.
Riebe and Naeseth (1947a) tested a one-step hull, modified from a model originally made as a
two-step hull, seen in Figure 4.14. The drag was reported as "about the same". The tests were
done at the same lab, at the same Reynolds numbers, but in different studies.
The TAC1 hull, on the other hand, is designed to have a one-step hull. This is mainly due to the
advantage this step type gives in hydrodynamic resistance, especially around the hump speed.

A plot of this decrease, as tested by Sottorf (1937) can be seen in Figure 4.15. A very similar
reduction in hydrodynamic drag was found by Dawson, Walter and Hay (1946)

one-step hull (labeled Planning tail). Source: Recolored by Prof. E. Wilczek, based on original figure from
Dawson, Walter and Hay (1946)
4.5 Length/Width Ratio
Coombes and Clark (1937) investigated the effect of length-to-width ratio on flying boats. And
found a clear drop in drag coefficient with higher length-to-width hulls when using the surface
area as the reference volume. The same trend was found by Riebe and Lowry (1948). It should
be noted that the difference is biggest when going from a ratio of 6 to a ratio of 9, while the
effect beyond 9 is lower, as surface friction drag then starts to increase significantly. The volume
inside these thinner fuselages is also lower.
29

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
4.6 Height/Width Ratio
Coombes and Clark (1937) republished results from a test done at an unspecified NACA wind
tunnel on varying the height of a flying boat hull. As expected, the drag increases with increased
height as both frontal area and surface area increase. The increase was, however, quite linear,
with a gradient of 1% increase in drag for every 2% increase in height. This trend, in combination
with the trend on length/width ratio, explains why many seaplanes have been relatively long,
tall, and slim.
4.7 Chines Radius and Flare
The chines and flare of the hull are methods to control spray but add a certain amount of
aerodynamic drag. Combes and Clark(1937) report a 5% increase in drag from adding flare, but
it is not specified how much flare other than visually by the image in Figure 4.16.
Figure 4.16: Effect of flare on air drag, as a function of angle of incidence. Figure edited based on two
figures from Coombes and Clark (1937)
Coombes and Clark (ibid.) also found a 1% decrease in aerodynamic drag possible by rounding
the chines with a radius, with the benefit flattening above a radius of about 10mm. This test’s
resultswereverydependentontheReynoldsnumber, astheflowboundarylayerwouldbetripped
by the chine if not already turbulent. Initial testing at Reynolds numbers between3.8 · 106 to
6.3 · 106 initially found a 2% decrease in drag when rounding the chines, but increasing the
Reynolds number to108 in later tests saw the impact half for the same radius’s.
A later test by Riebe and Naeseth (1947b) found a 5% reduction of drag by rounding the chine
radius. This test was done at a Reynolds number of2.4·106, but the boundary layer was tripped
at 5% of the length of the hull, so the effects seen by varying the Reynolds number should be a
lot less than what was seen by the untripped airflow tested by Coombes and Clark (1937).

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
4.8 Impact of Deadrise Angle
Deadrise angle, angle β as seen in Figure 2.3, has the biggest impact on the hydrodynamic
performance, especially the hydrodynamic resistance to get up to and during planning, but it
also affects the aerodynamic drag. The direct impact was tested for a set of floats by Parkinson,
RolandandHouse(1939), whichfoundthatahigherdeadriseangleledtoahigherdragcoefficient
when using the volume as a reference. Coombes and Clark (1937) found an 11% decrease in
overall drag when changing the deadrise angle from20◦ to 30◦.
Figure 4.17 shows the impact the deadrise angle has on hydrodynamics and loads. This trade-off
is typically the driving factor behind the choice of deadrise angle due to its relatively larger
impact.

given in deadrise dihedral angleα, not the typical definition of deadrise angle as described in Figure 2.3.
Figure borrowed from Sottorf (1937).
4.8.1 Deadrise Angle Warp
Hugli and Axt (1951) found that warping the afterbody deadrise by increasing the deadrise
from 20◦ at the step up to35◦ at the middle of the afterbody, before bringing it back to20◦
at the stern, significantly improved hydrodynamic performance. This allowed for the step to
31

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION
be decreased from 8.3% down to 4.2% of the beam, with similar hydrodynamical performance.
As discussed in Chapter 4.2.1, the step drag is roughly proportional to the step height. This
improvement would, therefore, most likely be half the step drag.
4.8.2 Afterbody Steps
One of the main drivers of hydrodynamic drag during planning is the spray on the afterbody.
One very effective way of reducing this drag is by separating the spray by the addition of auxiliary
steps behind the main step. Sottorf (1942) found a3◦ increase in upper limit stability by the
addition of these steps, as seen in Figure 4.18.
Figure 4.18: Increase of stability limit due to addition of smaller steps behind the rear step. Figure edited
based on original from Sottorf (1942)
Wilczek (2021) also reports a potential to reduce the hydrodynamic drag right before take-off by
up to 45% by the addition of auxiliary wedges, but the primary source was not directly cited, so
no further details are known. In more modern aircraft, the Beriev A-40 from 1986 implemented
auxiliary steps, as seen in Figure 4.19 This feature is especially interesting as it is outside the
main region of hydrodynamic forces and, therefore, might be easier to make retractable with
actuators.
4.9 Results Literature Study
Based on the literature reviewed, step-faring geometries were considered the most promising
option to reduce the drag of the TAC1 flying boat, potentially in combination with step
ventilation to increase hydrodynamical performance.
Auxiliaryafterbody stepscould be anattractive wayto improve thehydrodynamicalperformance
of a highly faired step further; however, it is not considered a viable option if it is not made
retractable. Therefore, testing the aerodynamic drag would not be of a big significance.
32

4 LITERATURE STUDY: AERODYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION

Sternpost angle was chosen as the second most important factor in getting good aerodynamic
data due to its combination of large impact on aerodynamic drag and relatively lower impact on
hydrodynamic performance.
The angle of incidence of the hull was seen as a third big improvement.
Chine radius showed varying degrees of drag reduction in the sources, but the negative effect
this feature would have on the spray characteristics was considered outside of the topic of this
thesis, and this feature was, therefore, not included in further testing.
33

5 WIND TUNNEL
5 Wind Tunnel
Based on the results from Chapter 4, it was decided to investigate the most promising features
in order to determine the aerodynamic drag reduction possible by changing these features. Wind
tunnel testing is a resource-intensive test method, but the large deviations between many of the
hull shapes in the literature study VS. the TAC1 hull meant that many of the results from the
literature were not directly transferable. Wind tunnel testing was initially chosen over CFD due
to the author’s lack of experience with CFD.
5.1 Test Objective
The primary test objective was to acquire data on the relative drag difference between different
faired steps. This data will then be used, together with data from hydrodynamic testing, to
make an informed decision on the step fairing design.
This test being about relative differences is important for the test setup, as it means that if the
results are slightly off due to, for example, a low Reynolds number, the comparative results will
still be similar. The usefulness of displaying the comparative results as a percentage of the full
fuselage drag means that the test should also aim to get the right fuselage drag, but the accuracy
could be lower than for factors affecting the relative difference between the geometries.
As discussed in Chapter 4.2.3, Coombes and Clark (1937) describes a non-linear relationship
between faring and drag reduction. Due to this, 11 step geometries were chosen, divided into
three series of step geometries, each varying one variable at a time. Based on recommendations
from Barlow, William and Pope (1966), a minimum of four geometries per test series was chosen
so that the loss of any one test sample would still yield a correlation graph. In addition, two
concave and one convex fully faired geometry and one without fairing were chosen, bringing the
total geometries to 14.
The series’ were as follows:
• Straight Faring, 0% depth of step. Lengths varying from 2 to 8 x the depth of step.
• Straight Faring, 1% depth of step. Lengths varying from 4 to 10 x the depth of step.
• Straight Faring, Length 6 x depth of step, varying starting depth from 0% to 3%.
Each faring was tested at an angle of attack from0◦ to 5◦
34

5 WIND TUNNEL
The tested geometries can be seen in appendix A.
It was chosen to only test two angles of afterbody. This was due to the difficulty and time
required to make this extension part. The current designed upsweep angle was chosen as the
base case, and a neutral upsweep angle was chosen as a second geometry in order to measure the
drag penalty of the upsweep.
5.2 Test Facility
The wind tunnel used in the test is the large-scale wind tunnel at NTNU, which has a cross-
section of 2.7m x 1.8m and a maximum speed of 16 m/s. For reference, the full-scale aircraft is
designed to cruise at 51 m/s at 1219 m altitude.
The wind tunnel used in this thesis is a closed-loop wind tunnel, similar to the example seen in
Figure 5.1. This type of wind tunnel requires a smaller motor and less power than a straight,
open wind tunnel, as the kinetic energy of the air is maintained. The NTNU wind tunnel required
about 54 kW just to maintain the airspeed at 16 m/s. This power is mainly dissipated in as
friction, heating up the air. Some larger wind tunnels have active water-cooled radiators to deal
with this. The NTNU wind tunnel does not have active cooling. On the day of testing, the air
started out at17◦C, and heated up to about28◦C before stabilizing. This temperature change
will change the air properties and must be accounted for.

5.2.1 Data Acquisition
For the test proposed, the primary metric of interest is the drag force. More specifically, the
relative change in aerodynamic drag was the most important factor. The small change in drag
35

5 WIND TUNNEL
between the different tested geometries required a precise measuring method.
Prior to the test, the full-scale aircraft drag of the features tested was calculated to 80.9
drag counts, with wing area as the reference area. The drag force expected can be found by
reversing the drag coefficient equation 3.1 to solve for the drag force, and usingV∞ = 16m/s,
ρ = 1.228kg/m3, andA = 0.357m2.
This gives an estimated drag force for the model of 0.454 N, or 46.3 grams. The drag due to the
step was estimated to be in the range of±10%, or±4.63grams.
Force Measuring

of the difference due to the step geometries. The force balance is completely isolated form the
main body of the wind tunnel, in order to reduce vibrations.
Measurements of forces were made with 5Hz frequency over a period of 30 seconds in order to
cancel out any fluctuations.

and converted to airspeed using Bernoulli’s equation. The pressures were measured using a
Setra Model 239 differential pressure transducer with a stated accuracy of±0.073% of full-scale
reading.

5 WIND TUNNEL
5.3 Model Design
5.3.1 Model Scaling Theory
When doing wind tunnel tests, it is often not feasible to test the model at full size due to
economical reasons. Scaled-down models are then used, but the difference must be accounted
for.
Reynolds Number
The Reynolds number is a dimensionless number used for aerodynamical compassion. Two flows
with the same Reynolds number will give similar results. As seen in the equation for the Reynolds
number 5.1, if the size is reduced, the fluid velocity must increase by a similar fraction, keeping
the other fluid variables constant. This is often not possible due to cost or physical limitations
like the speed of sound.
Re = ρ · u · L
µ (5.1)
We are then left with two options: changing the fluid parameters or accepting lower Reynolds
numbers. Some of the wind tunnel tests referred to in this thesis were tested in compressed air
tunnels. Another method is to use other mediums, like cooled nitrogen or water.
5.3.2 Model Size
The model was initially sized to fit in a smaller,0.5m2 wind tunnel at NTNU, with a wind
speed of 35 m/s. The model size was chosen to balance blockage percentage (see chapter 5.4.1),
model build effort, and Reynolds number. This analysis gave a size of 9% of the full scale,
which would have given a blockage factor of 7.5% and a Reynolds number of 6.7% of the full
scale. A comparison between the model size and scale model can be seen in Figure 5.3 Material
requirements generally scale with the size cubed, while the Reynolds number only scales with
size squared, so an increase in Reynolds number by increasing the size above this would quickly
have become very resource intensive.
Two weeks prior to the testing, it was decided to switch to a larger wind tunnel with lower top air
speed due to the increased availability of measuring equipment, mainly a digital six-component
force sensor and a rotatable floor, allowing for automatic and precise change in angle of incidence,
37

5 WIND TUNNEL
Figure 5.3: Scale Comparison between 9% model and full scale aircraft
as seen in Figure 5.2. The smaller wind tunnel only had an analog force sensor.
It was chosen not to rescale the model, even though a much larger model, up to 29% of full
scale, could now fit with a blockage ratio below 10%. With the new wind tunnel, the Reynolds
number was reduced from 6.7% to 3.0% of full-scale cruise Reynolds number due to a decrease
in tunnel airspeed. The new Reynolds number was1.43 · 106, when using the length from the
bow to the step as the characteristic length. This Reynolds number is high enough for the flow
to be turbulent.
It was recognized that this could affect the accuracy of the measurements, but it was believed that
actively tripping the boundary layer and having access to more accurate measuring equipment
would make up for this increase in Reynolds number difference. This difference in Reynolds
number would make the flow more prone to detaching, but this can then be seen as a safety
margin to the real-world case. If the flow stays attacked in the wind tunnel, it is more likely
to do so in real life. The Reynolds number will also affect the losses due to skin friction, and
this will act in the opposite direction, increasing drag with a higher Reynolds number. (Ansys
2020a)
Because of this, theCD plotted against the Reynolds number will often follow a pattern similar
to that seen in Figure 4.7. Notably, the relative difference between the fairings in this figure does
not change significantly. (ibid.)
A Reynolds sweep from 5 m/s up to 16 m/s was also planned in order to check the variability in
CD due to the Reynolds number.
38

5 WIND TUNNEL
5.3.3 Model Design and Production Method
Some design goals were set for the model used in the wind tunnel testing:
• Barlow, William and Pope (1966) suggests that the form similarity of the fuselage should
be within 0.25 mm of the intended position for a model with a wingspan between 1.8m
to 2.4m in low-speed wind tunnels. The scale model in this thesis would have had a wing
span of 1.89 m if it had wings and, therefore, falls into this size category.
• Model stiffness should be sufficient to avoid bending of the model, larger than the form
similarity goal above. This was achieved with internal extruded aluminum members. These
members also allowed for accurate alignment of the sections.
• Quickly interchangeable step geometries were required to be able to quickly test many
different step geometries. A sliding mechanism without any bolt holes was chosen.
• Interchangeable afterbody angle was required according to the test plan. As only two
geometries were to be tested, it was considered sufficient to bolt them to the model.
• Due to the chosen size, transport without disassembly would be challenging. A design that
allowed for splitting the model in half was set.
• Wing and tail mountings were added to make it possible to mount wings and full tail to
the model at a later stage. This allows the model to be reused for other tests or marketing,
reducing waste.
Historically, wind tunnel models have mostly been made from wood or milled aluminum. (ibid.)
For this thesis, 3D printing was chosen due to the accessibility to a 3D printer at Elfly. This
printer is a Bambu x1 printer with a build volume of 250x250x250 mm. This meant the model
had to be cut into sections in order to be printed. This production method will give a model
with a lower stiffness, geometric accuracy, and higher surface roughness than what could have
been achieved with aluminum as a trade-off against less resource-intensive production. The
aforementioned form similarity, stiffness, and surface roughness goals were considered achievable
with 3D printing.

model was printed in, the interchangeable parts of the model, and the stiffing aluminum beams running

Figure 5.5: Model in the process of being assembled. The rear section assembled, while the front sections
are in the the background
The model was made hollow before printing, reducing both required material and print time by
about 70%. The walls were made 10mm thick, with three printed layers on each side and 15%
infill between. The material used was PLA due to its low cost and sufficient strength for the
application.
Surface Roughness
Barlow, William and Pope (1966) suggests wet sanding the surface with No. 600 paper for
aluminum surfaces; however, this is for wind tunnel testing where the absolute drag is the drag
number of interest.
In the case of this test, as we care more about the relative drag, the surface finish is of lesser
importance. Activity tripping the boundary layer also reduces the impact of surface roughness
as it does not determine the transition point.
40

5 WIND TUNNEL
With these considerations in mind, as well as time restraints, it was chosen to use a combination
of machine and hand sanding with P120 and P240 was used, before hand sanding with P300.
Variable print height was used to reduce the needed surface sanding while balancing print times,
ranging from 0.08 mm to 0.28 mm layer height, depending on the gradient and features. The
largest imperfections were seen around holes used for fasting.
It was still important to get similar surface roughness for the interchangeable step sections as
deviations here would affect the comparative results, so extra care was taken to sand these a
similar amount.
5.4 Experimental Aerodynamics
5.4.1 Internal Flow Errors
A well-designed wind tunnel is able to replicate the airflow experienced in free flight quite well,
but there will always be some differences that need to be understood and compensated for.
In free flight, an aircraft experiences what is referred to as external flow, with little to no
interference from surrounding objects. The air is free to divert around the object, and the
static pressure is the same everywhere. In a wind tunnel, however, the flow is confined by walls,
known as internal flow. This causes some differences in the flow, which must be accounted for:
Blockage
When placing a model inside a tunnel section, the model will occupy some of the cross-section,
and the area available to the flow will shrink. In a closed tunnel, the air mass flow into the test
section will be the same as the flow out. If we assume the flow to be incompressible, the only
two variables that may change are speed and area, as seen in equation 5.2. (Barlow, William
and Pope 1966)
˙m = ρ · V · A = constant (5.2)
In order to keep the errors from this phenomenon small, it is generally recommended to keep the
blockage ratio, defined by equation 5.3 to below 5 - 10%. (ibid.) (Airshaper 2020)
BlockageRatio = ModelF rontalArea
T unnelFrontalArea (5.3)
41

5 WIND TUNNEL
As mentioned in chapter 5.3.2, the model was originally sized to have a blockage ratio of 7.5%.
With the swap to the larger wind tunnel, the blockage ratio was reduced to 0.8%. This increased
the local airflow speed from 16 m/s to 16.13 m/s.
Wall interference
Wall interference is the effect the wall has on the flow lines and vortexes generated by the model.
In general, we want the model to be far enough from the wall to avoid the wall interfering.
In aircraft testing, this is especially applicable to wing tip vortexes. (Airshaper 2020) The
phenomena can be seen in Figure 5.6.
Figure 5.6: Flow over a body in external and internal flow. Figure Borrowed from: Katz (1995)
This was the original reason for orienting the model sideways when the smaller wind tunnel was
planned to be used. This wind tunnel only had a height of 500 mm. Since the model was taller
than wide, orienting it on the side would increase the wall clearance from 125 mm to 162.5 mm.
With the larger wind tunnel, this factor was considered insignificant.
Static Buoyancy
As the flow in a wind tunnel is internal flow, there will be a pressure drop along the length
of the flow, as seen at the top of Figure 5.7. This pressure drop will create a static buoyancy
force in the horizontal direction if not accounted for, especially for longer bodies like the model
in this test. Therefore, some wind tunnels, including the large wind tunnel at NTNU, have
an expanding cross-section along the length of the flow. Due to Bernoulli’s law, this causes a
pressure increase along the flow length, counteracting the pressure drop due to wall interference.
(Leishman 2024c)
Boundary layer Growth
As explained in Chapter 5.2, the nozzle right in front of the test section also removes most of the
built-up boundary layer. Throughout the test section, the boundary layer will build back up.
42

5 WIND TUNNEL

the length of the test section. Figure borrowed from Leishman (2024c)
This can be seen in Figure 5.7, and reduces the effective flow area. This can also be counteracted
by a gradual increase in cross-section. This is done in the NTNU wind tunnel, as seen in Figure
5.9.
5.5 Other Aerodynamic Dissimilarities
Air densityThe local air density will matter as this is one of the inputs to, among others, the
Reynolds number and drag coefficient. This was adjusted for by measuring the air pressure on
the day of testing and comparing it to the standard atmospheric conditions at cruise altitude.
On the day of testing, the atmospheric pressure was measured to 733 mmHg (97.7 kPa), using
an analog mercury barometer. Air density was calculated using equation 5.4, with the help of a
calculator by Czernia and Szyk (2024). Recorded air pressure and temperatures were used. A
value for relative humidity of 50% was used as this was not measured.
ρ =
 pd
Rd · T

(5.4)
This gave an air density of1.12kg/m3. For comparison, at the intended cruise altitude of 1219
m, at 15◦C, air density is expected to be1.058kg/m3. These values are used when comparing
the Reynolds numbers.
Incompressible and compressible flow
43

5 WIND TUNNEL
Air is generally considered incompressible below a speed of Mach 0.32, as this is the threshold
where compressibility exceeds 5%. This is about twice the cruise speed of the TAC1. However,
the local flow may accelerate as it passes around the body and airfoil, causing the Mach number
to be higher locally. As seen in figure 5.8, the relationship between compressibility and Mach
number is not linear, and at speed above the TAC1 cruise speed, the effect increases quite
significantly. The formula for calculating the compressibility of air can be seen in equation 5.5.

Figure 5.8: Compressibility ratio VS. Mach number. Figure borrowed from Leishman (2024c)
At a speed of 51m/s, like that of the full-scale TAC1 aircraft, compressibility is only 1.1%,
and likely higher in certain regions. At the air speeds in the wind tunnel, the air will have a
compressibility of less than 0.1%. This error was not accounted for as the change in density is
highly localized and cannot be easily applied as a correction factor. It will be a source of error,
although small.
5.5.1 Boundary Layer Tripping
As discussed in section 3.1.2, the transition point between laminar and turbulent flow will vary
with the Reynolds number, and as the turbulent flow has higher drag than laminar and is more
resistant to flow separation, the point of transition will affect the measured values. When testing
in a wind tunnel at a lower Reynolds number than in real life, the transition will, therefore, occur
at a different point. To account for this, we can add an irregularity in the flow path in order to
force the air to become turbulent. This is called tripping the boundary layer. The height of the
44

5 WIND TUNNEL
trip strip should be high enough to ensure boundary layer tripping but not so high as to cause
separation or significant pressure drag. Barlow, William and Pope (1966) suggests placing the
trip strip where the diameter of the fuselage is half that of the maximum diameter. The paper
also shows a method of choosing the trip height by gradually varying it and observing at what
height theCD stabilizes. This was not done as the absolute drag was not the primary number
of interest, and a small increase in read drag was due to using a too-high trip strip being used.
Wind tunnel tests conducted at the NASA Langley Research Center by Ribere, Naeseth, Lowry,
and Yates all used transition strips in order to force transition to turbulent flow at a specific
point. A strip 12.7 mm wide, with 0.2 mm diameter particles was used to trip the boundary
layer at the desired position (5% of the hull length from the bow) The wind tunnel tests were
also corrected for blockage and buoyancy forces caused by the tunnel static pressure gradient.
Angles of attack were corrected for bending in structural members. (Riebe and Naeseth 1947b)
(Riebe and Lowry 1948) (Riebe and Yates 1947).
For this wind tunnel test, a 10 mm strip of No. 80 sandpaper was added at 85 mm from the
front of the model. The particle size is equivalent to what was used by the wind tunnel tests
mentioned, but the height of the paper was also included. This position is in the middle between
the two sources stated above. It is also at the position where the windshield starts, a feature
thought to trip the boundary layer at this position in the full-scale aircraft regardless. This trip
strip can be seen if Figure 5.9
5.5.2 Summary Wind Tunnel Corrections
Summary of corrections applied and error not accounted for:
• Reynolds number= 1.43 · 106 (3.0% of full aircraft Re)
• Blockage factor= 0.81% corrected for
• Static buoyancy and boundary layer growth= accounted for by tunnel geometry
• Force measurement accuracy= 0.22% of force range expected by steps
• Air speed measurement accuracy= ±0.073% of FS
• Air density and temperature= measured and corrected for
• Compressibility = error in air density estimated to be about 1.1%
• Boundary layer tripping= Tripped with No. 80 paper at 85 mm from the bow
This error buildup reflects the assumptions and calculations made prior to the testing.

5.6 Integration Into Wind Tunnel
The model was originally designed to be mounted on its side in order to give better clearance to
the wall and reduce wall interference, as the model is higher than its width, while the smaller
wind tunnel was wider than tall. When moving to the larger wind tunnel, it was decided to keep
this orientation due to the rotation floor, which would allow for accurate and fast changes in
the angle of attacks. This comes with the trade-off that flow visualization will be harder, as one
does not see the flow in a side-view against the high-contrast black wall.
Figure 5.9: Scale model in the wind tunnel
The model was mounted using a 30mm x 60 mm aluminum flex beam. The model had a 30 x 60
mm hole in the side, and bolts were used to fasten the model from the top of the model into two
threaded holes in the beam. The bolts were designed to be sunk into the model, and the holes
were taped over to reduce interference.
5.7 Missing Data Points
The data series for the geometry with no fairing only had measurements for 2◦, 4◦, and 6◦. This
was due to this being the intended sweep. However, after testing this geometry, it was chosen to
expand the sweep to 0◦to 5◦, at 1◦intervals due to how fast-changing angles turned out to be.
46

5 WIND TUNNEL
Some data points were also discovered to be missing due to human error. These data points
were:
• 1% depth of step, 10 x length of depth of step fairing, Angle of Incidence at 3◦
• Fully faired, Angle of Incidence at 5◦
5.8 Results
The results from the wind tunnel test were inconclusive. Most of the results were as expected,
like in Figure 5.10a, where the longer the fairing, the lower the drag. But some results, notably
from the tests with 1% depth of step, did not follow this trend. As seen in Figure 5.10b, the
results are reversed from what one would expect. This holds true even if you apply all the
corrections discussed earlier.
5.8.1 Flow Visualization
Flow visualization with a smoke wand was used to visualize the flow for two different geometries
and can be seen in Figure 5.11. A clear difference between the faired and unfaired steps can be
seen. The flow separation region is much larger with the unfaired step. The flow in the faired
step also does not seem to re-attach until the angle flattens back after the fairing.
5.9 Post Test Error Analysis
Since only a few data points were off and most aligned with the expected theory, it would be
tempting to disregard them and declare the results valid. However, if one assumes that the
underlying results are still there but with a large amount of random noise on top, this is exactly
what one would expect to get. Most results would be correct, but some, seemingly random,
would not be.
The main theory for the inclusive results is the lack of fairing of the mounting strut. The
original plan was to add a 3D printed fairing to the strut, but this was prioritized printed last
and dropped when the tail angle geometry failed three times in the printer. The lack of fairing
may have caused two problems in the readings. Figure 6.13 shows the flow around the strut,
and how in creates separation. This simulation is a RANS simulation that would not capture
vortexes.
47

5 WIND TUNNEL
(a) Force measured for the fairings with depth of step 0
(b) Force measured for the fairings with depth of step 1%
Firstly, a large amount of noise can be seen in the measured signal, as seen in Figure 5.12. The
noise far exceeds the expected measured drag change due to the change in geometry. This could
be an issue related to the flow or measuring, but it is thought to be more likely related to flow
separation around the strut used to mount the model. Blunt objects can cause vortex shedding,
as seen in Figure 5.13. It should be noted that vortex shedding is typically percent in Reynolds
numbers from 1 to103, while the Reynolds number in the wind tunnel over the mounting strut
is about6 · 104. (Ansys 2020a)

(b) Depth of step 1%. Length of fairing 6 times the

Figure 5.11: Smoke visualization of flow separation. Wind speed: 5m/s
This error could have been avoided by checking the drag expected from the strut and comparing
it to the The strut had a frontal area of about 67% of the fuselage, but as seen in Figure 3.5, the
drag coefficient can vary by more than an order of magnitude depending on the shape. While
a rectangular shape can have a drag coefficient based on frontal area around 2, fairing it could
bring it down to less than a tenth of that. This would have made the drag from the strut about
equal to the fuselage, not an order of magnitude larger.
Another thing that could have caught this error is doing a CFD run on the test set-up. This
is a common thing to do for wind tunnel testing, as it allows, among other things, to check for
interference between vortexes and the walls. However, as the plan up until the day before the
testing was to fair the strut, the CFD would probably have been run with a fairing, not catching
the error.

period.

The second error was not recording the air speeds measured during the runs. The air speeds
were measured as a pressure differential and converted to speeds with a MATLAB script created
by the NTNU lab. These were observed to be16±0.05m/s for all the runs, and this was thought
to be accurate enough that it would not need to be adjusted for. If converting to expected force
variation, this would only mean a variation of±0.6% of the force on the model. The error made
was to not account for the fact that this error would also affect the strut, and as the strut had
a drag about ten times that of the model, the variation in drag force measured due to a change
in airspeed by only±0.05m/s would actually cause an error up to±6%, not ±0.6%. Errors
related to the reading of airspeed, discussed in Chapter 5.2.1, would add to this error, also with
a multiplier factor of 10.
The error estimation was also somewhat made complicated by not having access to the data
50

5 WIND TUNNEL
sheets for the equipment in the wind tunnel. A secondary source, a master thesis from 2021
utilizing the same tunnel, was used for the source of information on the wind tunnel accuracy.
Due to this, an error buildup analysis of the wind speed accuracy was not possible. A number
on the accuracy of 0.073% of full scale reading was found, but not what the full scale reading of
the equipment was.
The accuracy of the wind tunnel force balance was found in the thesis, but it was not clear if
this was the absolute accuracy, repeatability, or the resolution. Due to the measurement being
zeroed between each run, absolute accuracy and repeatability would in effect be the same for
this setup.
51

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
6 CFD Study of Step Geometry
Due to the inconclusive wind tunnel results, it was decided to do a limited study in CFD to
obtain the results not obtained in the wind tunnel. Although the wind tunnel test did not show
the drag difference of step fairings as desired, it could still be used as a validation case to validate
the CFD setup.
SimScale was used to run the CFD, using an academic thesis license provided by the SimScale
team. SimScale provides an interface that integrates meshing, simulation set-up, and post-
prepossessing in one platform. SimScale utilizes open-source solvers from Open-foam in the
background. The service also comes with cloud computing, allowing the simulations to be set
up and run without the need for expensive computing hardware.
CFD is a very complex topic that requires years to fully understand. In this thesis, the following
factors were considered when setting up the mesh and simulation:
Factors considered and goals set
• k − ω SST chosen as RANS model
• Y + target of 1 with full resolving of the boundary layer, between 0.7 - 1.5 reached.
• Inflation layer growth rate of 1.47
• Mesh resolution study conducted
• Convergence of total force in X direction used as measure of convergence
For most other values, default or values recommended by SimScale (2024b) were used.
6.1 Choice of CFD Model
CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) is a method to estimate the airflow. The key word is
estimate, and no CFD solver will be perfect. There are three main categories of CFD solvers,
seen in Figure 6.1. DNS is the most computationally resource intensive, while RANS, is the least
resource intensive. (LEAP 2018)
An example of a downside of using a RANS model is that if we wanted to check if the strut used
in the wind tunnel modeling caused vibrations due to large eddies forming, the RANS would not
capture this.
52

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
Figure 6.1: Difference between solvers methods. Image Borrowed from: LEAP (2018)
In this thesis, RANS will be used due to the computational power available and the accuracy
required.
6.1.1 RANS turbulence model
Many RANS turbulence models exist, but the most popular are the following:
Spalart-Allmaras is a one equation model. Has some limitations in modeling separated flows.
k-epsilon is a popular two-equation turbulence model, with one equation for turbulent kinetic
energy andk−ϵ one for turbulent energy dissipation. The model does not always solve boundary
layer flow with adverse pressure gradients well.
k-omegais another two-equation turbulence model that is known to better model the boundary
layer.
k-omega SST uses k − ω for near-wall boundary wall prediction and thek − ϵ in the free
stream, combining the strengths of these two models. It is known to give a good prediction of
flow separation.
6.1.2 Choosing a RANS Turbulence Model
VersteefandMalalasekera(2007)recommendstheSpalart-Allmaras, k−ω ork−ω SSTturbulence
model for external aerodynamics. Thek − ω is stated to perform best over a backwards-facing
step.
Sazak (2017) did a CFD study comparingk − ϵ, Spalart-Allmaras, andk − ω SST, specifically
for seaplane floats, up against validation data from a NACA wind tunnel test. In this test, the
53

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
k − ω SST came out with the best results, with an error of about 10% of the wind tunnel test.
An example validation case run by SimScale for a body with a backwards-facing step also used
the k − ω SST model. (SimScale 2024a)
Based on these considerations, it was chosen to use thek − ω SST turbulence model.
6.2 CAD Model Preparation and Import
A guideline from SimScale on how to import and set up the boundary conditions was used.
(SimScale 2024b)
The simulation was run with a symmetry plane down the symmetric axes of the aircraft in order
to reduce the computational cost. The remaining three walls were set up with slip condition,
while the inlet was set as velocity inlet and the outlet as pressure outlet.
Figure 6.2: Flow volume set up as a function of the model size
6.3 Meshing
6.3.1 Inflation Layers
Modelingtheflowbehaviorintheboundarylayer, andespeciallytheskinfrictionforcesthatcome
from it, is important to get accurate CFD results. There are two primary methods of achieving
this, either through very thin inflation layers that contain the boundary layer or through not
modeling the boundary layer but having the CFD solver use correction factors known as wall
functions. (Ansys 2020b)
Figure 6.3 shows the breakdown of a boundary layer. We either want the first inflation height
to be within the thinnest laminar sub-layer or cover the entire boundary layer with one cell.
The reason for this can be seen in the right part of Figure 6.3. CFD solvers linearly interpolate
54

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
between nodes, and if there are mesh layers in the boundary layer, the linear interpolation will
create an offset.
Figure 6.3: Example of buildup of a turbulent boundary layer, and linear interpolation error. Image edited
based on original images from Ansys (2020b) and Wimshurst (2022)
A unitless value, known asY +, is used in order to describe how far into the boundary layer the
first cell height reaches.
If we are using wall functions, we generally wantY + to be larger than 350. If we are resolving
the boundary layer, we want aY + less than 5. A goal forY + of 1 is commonly used. (Ansys
2020b)
As wall functions do not predict flow separation well, we will aim for a lowY + value in this
study. (Wimshurst 2022)
We also want to make sure the boundary layer is contained within the inflation layers, as seen
in Figure 6.4.
Figure 6.4: Inflation layers should be contained within the inflation layers, as seen in the right image, in
order to resolve the boundary layer properly. Image borrowed from Wimshurst (2021a)
A third factor to keep in mind is the layer growth. The cell volume growth within the inflation
layers should preferably not exceed 1.3. The difference in volume from one cell to another should
not be too large. This is particularly important in the transition from the inflation layers to the
55

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
main mesh, as seen in Figure 6.5.
Figure 6.5: Example image of good and poor volume transition between inflation layer. Image borrowed
from Wimshurst (2021a)
Based on these considerations, a tool by Wimshurst (2021b) was used to estimate inflation layers
parameters. This tool inputs values for velocity, characteristic length, viscosity, density, targeted
Y +, and a number of inflation layers. The output is first layer height, final layer height, boundary
layer thickness, and growth ratio.
The values used in this study can be seen in Figure 6.6.
The growth rate had to be higher than the recommended 1.3 as this would have required 28
layers, and the SimScale solver only permits 20 layers.
This only gives a first estimate to choose inflation layer parameters. The actualY + will be
calculated by the CFD solver when it runs, and one might have to iteratively change the inflation
layer parameters to get the desiredY + value.
Figure 6.6: Input and output values used for determining the inflation layer in the mesh
56

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
6.3.2 Mesh Resolution
Mesh resolution is another important factor in CFD accuracy. It is good practice to do a mesh
independence study, where one gradually varies the mesh resolution and observes the changes in
output.
As a baseline for this study, we can look at two mesh independence studies done by SimScale
(2024a) and Sazak (2017), both for similar shapes and with wind tunnel data for comparison.
Both studies usedk − ω SST.
The mesh study done by Sazak (ibid.) decreased the deviation to the wind tunnel data from 18%
to 9% by increasing the mesh from 2.74 million to 10.44 million. In the end, theCD had more
or less stabilized. This was for a seaplane float.
The mesh study done by SimScale (2024a) decreased the deviation to the wind tunnel data from
17% to 6% by increasing the mesh from 3.8 million to 23.8 million. Here, the mesh had not
stabilized at 10 million cells but stabilized when it increased to 23.8 million. This shape was a
blunt body with a sharp break at the rear to cause flow separation.
Figure 6.7: Mesh independence study performed on the TAC1 hull
Figure 6.7 shows the mesh independence study performed. The results stabilized after 4.7 million
cells. Although the 12M cell mesh might give more accurate results, the difference Vs the extra
required computational power, was not considered a good trade-off.
The rest of the study was therefore conducted with the 4.7 million cell count mesh. No mesh
57

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
qualities were changed between runs from this point.
6.3.3 Refinement Regions
In order to get the most out of the mesh cell count, refinement regions are used to increase the
mesh count where it is needed the most. Three volumetric regions, two containing the entire
aircraft and one around the step region, were used, as seen in Figure 6.8.
Figure 6.8: Refinement regions used for this CFD study. A third volume was used around the step region
but is not that visible in the image.
In addition, a surface refinement was used in order to increase the mesh’s detail around the
curves on the model.
Figure 6.9 and C.1 shows the final mesh with 4.7 million cell count. Figure C.3 shows theY +
for the run without step fairing.
Figure 6.9: Mesh used in the CFD study comparing steps
6.4 Runs
The following geometries were run in the CFD study:
• 0% depth of step, with straight fairings lengths from 2 to 8 x the depth of step
• 1% depth of step, with straight fairings lengths from 4 to 10 x the depth of step
• 2% and 3% depth of step, with straight fairings lengths of 6 x the depth of step
• Geometry with no fairing
• Geometry with baseline concave fairing
No angle of attack sweeps were conducted.
58

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
The second concave faring and the fully faired fairing were omitted due to time constraints.
6.5 Results
The results from the CFD study can be seen in Figure 6.10. The results are expressed as the
drag force reduction, with the non-faired 5.8% depth of step as a baseline.
Two series, one for the 1% depth of step and the other for 2% depth of step, is plotted. The rest
of the results are plotted as single data points. The concave fairing did not fit onto the x-axis
and is instead plotted as a dashed horizontal line.
Figure 6.10: Results from CFD step study. The drag of the fairings is given as a percentage decrease
compared to the non-faired step with a depth of 5.8%. The x-axis is the length of the fairing for that run
For all the data points, the skin friction was more or less constant, around 270 to 273 Newton.
The main source of difference was the pressure drag.
6.6 Discussion on the Accuracy and Confidence in the Results
Two data points do not follow the trend of what was expected, as do the last two points of the
two series. For these points, the drag increases with longer fairing.
For the data point on the 0% depth of step series, this might be due to errors with the previous
59

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
Figure 6.11: Flow field around aircraft showing flow separation behind the step without fairing
data point (0% depth of step, length of faring 6). This run failed to converge twice, and the
mesh was, therefore, slightly tweaked. For the last data point on the 1% depth of step, no good
explanation was found for why the drag increased.
This unexplained increased increase decreases the confidence in the data, as there might be an
error in the simulation set-up.
6.6.1 Flow Separation Comparison
The flow separation behind the un-faried step, seen if Figure 6.11, was very similar to the flow
separation seen in the wind tunnel, seen in Figure 5.11a, both in length and height. This is a
good sign that the simulation might treat the separation correct. It should be noted that the
flow visualization in the wind tunnel was done at only 5 m/s while this CFD run is at 51 m/s,
so not too much emphasis should be put on this.
6.6.2 Convergence
Looking at the convergence of the force data, it was clear that the simulations were not fully
converging in the 1000 iterations it were running. One simulation run was set to 3000 iterations
to see how far from convergence the runs were.
As seen in Figure 6.12, the results did not converge until after about 3000 iterations. Running
all the runs at this length would have tripled the run time and computational power required,
and would not have been feasible with the core hours allocated, without reducing mesh size.
Instead, it was checked that each run got to about the same gradient of convergence. It was
then thought that the remaining convergence would affect all runs similarly, and that the results
as a percentage of each other would be similar. This was checked for one fairing, the 1% depth
of step, 6 times the length fairing, running both that fairing and the non faired step to 3000
60

6 CFD STUDY OF STEP GEOMETRY
iterations. The difference in percentage at 1000 iterations was 6.3% and after 3000 attentions,
7.1%. This should therefore not significantly change the comparative results.
Figure 6.12: Convergence of a CFD run, over 3000 iterations
If the absolute number on the drag is to be used, a correction factor should be applied to the
CFD results. The converged results after 3000 iterations were 17.1% higher than the results after
1000 itterations.
6.6.3 Validation Case: Compare to Wind Tunnel Data
The same test set-up, as in the wind tunnel, was also run in the CFD. The CFD estimated 5.2N
for the mounting strut and 1.2N for the model under the same conditions as in the wind tunnel.
This is 19% higher than what was measured in the wind tunnel.
The mesh was not very refined, and the mounting strut had some differences, like missing fillets
on the corner in the CFD. With this in mind, 19% accuracy is within what could be expected.
As seen earlier in this chapter, errors in other wind tunnel testings were in the range of 17% to
7%, compared to wind tunnel data.
61

strut can be clearly seen. The surface of the model is plotted with a pressure field in [Pa], while the
surrounding filed is plotted with velocity [m/S]. Model seen from top view
6.6.4 Comparing Results to Expected Values Based on Theory
The overall test aligned well with what was expected from the theory. The same non-linear trend
shown by Coombes and Clark (1937) is seen. The fairings not starting from 0% depth of step
are also seen to be a lot less effective, similar to what was shown by Coombes and Clark (ibid.).
The effect of fairing the step at 2% and 3% starting depth was smaller than what was expected.
62

7 CONCLUSION
7 Conclusion
The objective of the thesis was to investigate the potential for reducing the aerodynamic drag
of a flying boat hull. From the literature study and tests done, the following conclusions can be
drawn:
Summary of conclusions
• The minimum drag of a flying boat can be expected at a positive angle of incidence
• Step fairings can be effective in reducing the drag by up to 15% of hull drag
• Step with a start depth of step can only be expected to provide a maximum of half
the drag reduction achievable with a fairing starting at 0% depth of the step
• Features like afterbody angle, deadrise warp, step ventilation, and auxiliary steps
can be a way to reduce the required step or allow for more aggressive fairing
In addition, the thesis work has gathered and sorted an extensive database of more than 50
sources on flying boat hull design that can be used for further development.
The method for testing many step fairings in a short period, by making a small part of the model
interchangeable, also proved to be effective and could be implemented also for hydrodynamic
testing.
63

8 FUTURE WORK
8 Future Work
Due to time constraints, the number of CFD runs was limited. More CFD runs, particularly the
angle of incidence and the remaining geometries from the wind tunnel, should be run.
After that, the next step in the development would be to use the results from this thesis in a
trade-off against results from hydrodynamic testing.
The steps with a starting depth of step did not significantly reduce drag, and these are thought
to be the ones with the most promising hydrodynamic performance. If the hydrodynamic testing
proves that these are the only feasible step fairings, a movable step could be considered.
The first step in that development is to determine the criticality of landing with the extended
fairing and the loads/suction that acts on the fairing.
